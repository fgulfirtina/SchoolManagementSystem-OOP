# School Management System (Java OOP Project)

## About the Project
The main goal of this project is to implement a **School Management System** using **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. 
Instead of a database, all operations are handled with **text files**.

This system was developed as part of the OOP course, with the primary objective of practicing:
* Encapsulation  
* Inheritance  
* Polymorphism  
* Design Patterns   
* UML Use Case Diagrams
* Unit Tests

## Features
* Add, update, delete student records  
* Manage courses and grades (tests, homework, projects, etc.)  
* Role-based operations (students, teachers, admins)  
* Data consistency and validation checks  
* Text-file-based data persistence (instead of database)
* Unit tests with Maven

* These are not real personal data.
* Any resemblance to real persons is purely coincidental.
* The files are provided only for demonstration purposes.
